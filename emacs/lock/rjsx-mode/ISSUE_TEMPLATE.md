If your issue is related to indentation, here's a quote from the README:

> **Note**: This mode does not add any indentation improvements to the one
built into `js-mode`. Please report all identation bugs there

If not, please check if the bug still exists when using `js2-jsx-mode` (if
applicable). If so, it is most likely an upstream bug and should be
reported there.
